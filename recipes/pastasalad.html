    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>Pasta salad is a refreshing and versatile dish that combines cooked pasta with a mix of fresh vegetables, herbs, and a flavorful dressing. It’s a popular side dish for picnics, potlucks, and barbecues, and it can also be served as a light main course. The base typically includes short pasta like rotini or penne, mixed with ingredients such as cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, olives, and cheese. The variety of colors and textures makes pasta salad both visually appealing and delicious.</p>
    <p>To prepare the salad, the pasta is first cooked and then cooled to room temperature. Once cooled, it is tossed with chopped vegetables and coated in a zesty dressing—usually made from olive oil, vinegar, mustard, and seasonings. Some variations include protein options like grilled chicken or chickpeas. Pasta salad is best served chilled, and it tastes even better after being refrigerated for a few hours to allow the flavors to blend. It’s an easy, make-ahead recipe that’s perfect for any occasion.</p>
